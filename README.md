# Bouncy

Android arcade game using OOP principles inspired from the arcade game Breakout. 

The game is based on the idea of playing as long as possible, as multiple balls with increasing speeds start falling and your paddle is the only thing preventing them from breaking. 

The code was lost and retrieved from the .apk file which explains the lack of documentation. Eventually, documentation will be added and updated in the code.
